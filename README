All <imageBase> files (imageBase.data and raw files) need to be put into data folder


Invoke Application:
1) Call ./volimage <imageBase> [-d i j output_file_name] [-x i output_file_name] in folder
2) Can use make run - But need to change arguments in the Makefile


Makefile:
make - compiles all files and creates executable volimage that can be run
make run - runs volimage executable [need to specify arguments inside Makefile]
make clean - removes executable and object files


volimage.h:
Methods used in volimage.cpp are declared, as well as the constructor & destructor. 
Private members width, height and vector<unsigned char **> are also declared.


volimage.cpp:
The functionality for the methods used are defined in this file.


driver.cpp:
This file parses the command line to get the arguments that are needed to call the VolImage methods.
It checks which operation is selected by the user and calls the appropriate functions.
